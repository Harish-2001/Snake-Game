# Snake-Game
This was my favourite game during childhood I used to play a lot. I coded the game in python by importing two modules **TURTLE** and **RANDOM**. <br />
Firstly, we need to install turtle. If you donâ€™t have it already installed, open your cmd and type in the following command.
```
pip install turtle
```
Now we will install the random module. The random module is used to generate random numbers. In your cmd type in the following command.
```
pip install random2
```
Code yourself and try it guys!
